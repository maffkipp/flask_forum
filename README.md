# Flask Forum

This is a simple forum app made using flask with mongoengine and wtforms. Users can make posts and comment on posts. 

A demo version of the app is hosted on [Heroku](https://my-flask-forum.herokuapp.com/).

If I were to continue work on this app in the future, I would add support for persistent user accounts, including the ability to delete previous posts/comments. I would also add support for branching comment threads.
